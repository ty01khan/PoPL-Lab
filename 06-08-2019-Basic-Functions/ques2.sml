(* there are 3 function in this code named fst, snd and thd *)

(* the first function "fst" will take three inputs of type x, y and z and returning an output of type x *)

fun fst(x, _, _) = x;


(* the second function "snd" will take three inputs of type x, y and z and returning an output of type y *)

fun snd(_, y, _) = y;


(* the third function "thd" will take three inputs of type x, y and z and returning an output of type z *)

fun thd(_, _, z) = z;
